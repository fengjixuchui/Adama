### Rules and Searches for CVE-2020-0601

So there are a couple of ways to look for this. Both searches in KQL format are in the file here named CVE-2020-0601.ndjson which can be imported into Kibana.

1. This search, which has been generally proposed and adopted, matches on any events in the 'Microsoft-Windows-Audit-CVE' - at the time of this writing, nothing is thought to populate these event log messages except exploit activity involving this CVE:

winlog.provider_name:"Microsoft-Windows-Audit-CVE"

2. Vulnerability assessment: it is also possible to search for the presence of the DLL with this vulnerability. The DLL is named crypt32.dll and the unpatched versions match the image file hashes in this search;

hash.sha256:e832e3a58b542e15a169b1545ce82451ace19bd361fd81764383048528f9b540 or hash.sha1:7a9dd389b0e3c124d4bfe5c1ff15f9a93285514f

This DLL shows up in sysmon event 7, Image Loaded, and that event would need to be enabled in the sysmon manifest in order to pick these up. One or another of the SHA hashes must also be enabled. All of this is enabled in my new sysmon manifest that produces these and other classes of events needed for frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, which lives here: https://github.com/randomuserid/Tylium/blob/master/Windows/sysmon-att%26ck.xml
